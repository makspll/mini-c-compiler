structdecl ::= structtype "{" (vardecl)+ "}" ";"    # structure declaration

vardecl    ::= type IDENT (";" |                    # normal declaration, e.g. int a or
                          "[" INT_LITERAL "]" ";")  # array declaration, e.g. int a[2]

fundecl    ::= type IDENT "(" params ")" block    # function declaration

type       ::= ("int" | "char" | "void" | structtype) ["*"]
structtype ::= "struct" IDENT

params     ::= [ type IDENT ("," type IDENT)* ]
